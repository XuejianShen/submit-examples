# Quick Documentation
# ===================
# 
# The files which are required/recommended:
# 
# 
#  a) submit
# 
#     this is the configuration file of your condor submission that defines what the condor submission
#     is suppose to do. There are always three components: 1 - input, 2 - executable, 3 - output and
#     well if you want of course some parameters. The submit file can be rather long and tedious to
#     create, it is therefore a good idea to generate it.
# 
#  b) generate_sub
# 
#     this is a little script that will construct the configuration used for condor submission. The
#     reason why you want to have a script to generate your submit file is that it is very repetitive
#     and error prone to write those down explicitely, of course you can.
# 
# The steps
# 
# start fresh (delete error, output and log files)
rm *.err *.out *.log

# generate the submission script
./generate_sub 1 15

# submit it to condor
condor_submit submit
