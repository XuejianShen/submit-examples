# Jupyter Notebook Tutorial

This directory contains a couple of simple examples on how to use JupyterHub. In order to run these tutorials you may need to create a sample conda environment. Instructions are below. Once that is done JupyterHub can recognize the environemnt and run your code.


```
conda create --name notebook python=3.8
conda activate notebook
conda install coffea
conda install vector
```

If this is the first time setting up Conda, you can download conda-forge:

```
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
# Run and follow instructions on screen
bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
