YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE EXCECUTABLE DIR AS WELL AS THE CONDOR OUTPUT IN:
-> submit.condor

mkdir scratch output

We want to run python_script.py which ouputs files in the output/ directory (outfile_XA.txt).

>> python setup.py (generates the DAGMan in scratch dir)
>> condor_submit_dag scratch/dag.submit (submits to cluster)

Files will appear in the output/ directory.
